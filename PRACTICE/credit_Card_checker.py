How to check the validity of your card?
You can check whether your credit or debit card is really valid or not by following the steps mentioned below. 
Take, for example, the card number: 4417 1234 5678 9113

Step 1: Start from the right side and separate all the even and odd digits.

4417 1234 5678 9113

odd_digits = 41 13 57 91                          
even_digits = 47 24 68 13

Step 2: Double all the digits in the first set(odd_digits)

82 26 (10)(14) (18)2        

Step 3: Add all double digit numbers as the sum of their digits.

82 26 (1+0)(1+4)  (1+8)2                              
82 26 15 92 is now odd_digits after step 2 and 3                                                        

Step 4: Add all the odd digits (those that have not been doubled) to the even (doubled) digits.

8 + 2 + 2 + 6 + 1 + 5 + 9 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 2 + 4 +  6 + 8 + 1 + 3 = 70
------------odd_digits-------|||------------even_digits-------

Step 5: Final result â€“ If the final result is divisible by 10, the card number is valid.

70/10=7 (The number is valid)
