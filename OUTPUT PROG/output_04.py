x = 45
while x < 50:
    print(x)
    break   # otherwise it will go into infinite loop as while condition will always be true.
    # or we can take value of x as an input from the user. if user enter value of x greater
    # than 50 program will executed and doesn't enter into while loop and print nothing.
