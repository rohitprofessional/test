string = '''One big part of comprehension is having a sufficient vocabulary,
or knowing the meanings of enough words.  Readers who have strong comprehension
are able to draw conclusions about what they read --  what is important, what is 
a fact, what caused an event to happen, which characters are    funny.
Thus comprehension involves combining reading with thinking and reasoning.'''
